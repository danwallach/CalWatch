Here's an output from the event layout:

TODO prerender background, only redraw it when screen changes; blt it to the screen all the time
-- Tried it and got a *lower* framerate; the cost of bitblt seems to really matter, at least at
   the high res on a Nexus 5. Revisit later on an actual Android Wear watch where the resolution
   is so much lower.

   Git note: preliminary code 'stashed' on my laptop.
   Root: c5e2c9851167e2221ec55b4f7f00291887ac8e89
   Branch: b3a5c0b1485751235dd36564e5900f78379b942e (branchBackground)

   New idea: cache *paths* rather than bitmaps. This will avoid a lot of trig, and the paths will
   probably be loaded into the GPU, avoiding some bus bandwidth.

-- The cache is implemented. No real performance bump. Some N7 numbers: 47-53 FPS when in landscape,
   28-29 FPS when in portrait. This implies that the essential difference is simply the cost of pushing
   more pixels to the bigger screen, since it's the same exact CPU usage; just different GPU load.

   Also tried breaking the complex path with 60 ticks into 60 little paths. Zero difference.

   Curiously, switching from "tool" to "lite" mode changes FPS from 29 to 42-51FPS. It's hard to believe
   that just a few tick marks makes such a big performance difference, but then there you go. Hopefully,
   all of this will be irrelevant when we get to the phone, with its insanely low-res screen.

TODO deal with recurring events
-- RecurrenceProcessor.expand() seems to do exactly what I want. Hypothetically, this is going to
   be a quick hack, if it work.

   maybe I need a better RFC 2245 (iCal) parser? Google has one:
   https://code.google.com/p/google-rfc-2445/

   Curiously, it's blowing up on the E2E VIV office hours, which has an exDate field of this:
   America/Los_Angeles;20140815T100000,20140822T100000,20140829T100000)

   The claim is that there's a "missing LHS" in the timezone part. Hrmm.

TODO port to Android Wear
-- Useful article including sample code: http://toastdroid.com/2014/07/18/developing-watchfaces-for-android-wear/
-- How to set up the damn emulator: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/49586/how-do-i-connect-an-android-wear-emulator-to-a-real-phone/

Subtasks:
    TODO sort out DataItems to move data from phone to watch (use shiny new proto bufs)
    TODO move calendar scraping from main app to a separate service
    TODO and get things rendering locally and remotely?

    TODO service needs to deal with all the persistent state; app kicks service, service kicks watch

    TODO verify on round face
    TODO deal with dimming (kill second hand? lower frame rate? all white?)

TODO sort out how to compile protobufs automatically via Gradle (vs. known bugs lodged with Google)
-- At least the Square protobuf runtime is automatically fetched and compiled





TODO fancier control panel: Material Layout cards
