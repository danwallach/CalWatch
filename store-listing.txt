This watch face reads your calendar and displays your events for the next twelve hours around the
watch dial, using the same colors and visibility as your real calendar. With the configuration
panel, you can choose from several different face styles, as well as turning on or off the day/date block.
You can additionally select any complications you wish to add to your watchface.

(Complication support require a Wear 2 device.)

<b>Installation</b>

Once you install CalWatch2, it will show up in the list of watchfaces on your watch as well as in
the Wear OS app on your phone. You can select it in either place.

<b>A few cool features</b>

&bull; The second hand has a non-linear sweeping effect, similar to what you'll see in many
European railroad clocks.

&bull; Once your battery is below 33%, a yellow circle appears in the center. As the battery
level drops, the circle grows. At 10% battery remaining, it turns red.

&bull; CalWatch2 works correctly with "ambient" mode, including "low-bit" mode on watches that require it.

&bull; If you have a Moto 360 or other "flat bottom" round watch, CalWatch2 will adjust itself appropriately.

&bull; The calendars events shown on the watch face are exactly the calendar events that are
visible from the calendar app on your phone, with the same event times and colors. If you want
to change what's visible on your watch, run Wear OS app on your phone, then select "Agenda settings".
<i>Note that WearOS can take a few minutes for calendar changes to update on your watch. CalWatch2
responds as quickly as it can.</i>

&bull; The watch will display your calendar events within a twelve hour window. If, for example,
it's 9:30am, you'll see events starting at 9:00am and lasting through 8:59pm. Any events that
started before 9am but end in the visible region will still appear, but their start time will
be clipped. Likewise, any events that start in the visible region but end afterward will have
the end time clipped. This clipping is shown on the watch face with the ragged edge around
events at the clipping line.

&bull; CalWatch2 ignores "all day" or any event that would make a full circle around the dial.
This gives you more room to see the events that start and end in the next 12 hours.

<b>Permissions and privacy</b>

<i>CalWatch2 does not transmit your personal information to anybody!</i> CalWatch2 reads your
calendar and displays it locally, but never sends anything to the network.
