If you look at the full Git history of this file, you'll see it grew quite large at some points and
shrank down at others. Mostly it's served as the ongoing to-do list as well as notes for features in
progress.

==================================================================================================

Port to Android Wear
-- How to set up the emulator: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/49586/how-do-i-connect-an-android-wear-emulator-to-a-real-phone/
   adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601

-- How to connect to Bluetooth debugging for Moto 360: http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2014/07/16/common-android-wear-tasks-for-developers/
    adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub; adb connect localhost:4444

-- How to get a dump from the watch into a file and see it while it's going
    adb -s localhost:4444 logcat -v time | & tee logdumps/whatever.txt


Daydream?
    http://www.hascode.com/2013/01/using-the-android-daydream-api/
    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/dreams/DreamService.html
    -- looks almost exactly the same as implementing an activity, or the watchface API

Refactoring / reengineering
    TODO significant code overlap between mobile/MyViewAnim and wear/CalWatchFaceService
    - but differences are significant enough that it's not going to be very easy to move to /shared

    TODO fix Gradle, presently requiring me to have the git version code in three places to work right
    (I tried putting it just in settings.gradle or the top-level build.gradle and this didn't work)

Right-to-left support
    TODO detect when we're in RTL mode
    TODO swap day/date block from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock or leave alone?

Add internationalization strings
    Currently have localized strings for Spanish, Dutch, Turkish, German; need more

Deal with multiday events that aren't "all day" events
    TODO idea: resurrect all-day events by rendering them (and long events) as thin rings, perhaps separate from the main time wedges

TODO reshape around peek card?
    - Notes: the rect we get back is the rect *covered* by the card. Using the "top"
      of the rect, we'll know that from (0,0) - (full-width, rect-top) we're good to draw.

    - Given how large the cards are, we probably don't want to mess with the Moto 360 hack
      but instead just want to draw the face small, completely round, and be done with it.

    - Current kludge: draw a solid black rectangle inside the rect we're given

    - Potential real solution: extend the Moto 360 flat-bottom hack
      - Option 1: same watch center, just increase missingBottomPixels
      - Option 2: move watch center up partly

TODO update the slides

Longer-term items
    Way, way, way too many colors in ClockFace
    TODO have a handful of colors, named for where they're used, centralize how they're set & reset
        - The low-bit ambient mode graphics are, at best, tolerable. Some cleanup in ClockFace
          would make it easier to modify this in one place.
    TODO custom background images?
