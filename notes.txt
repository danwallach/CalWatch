If you look at the full Git history of this file, you'll see it grew quite large at some points and
shrank down at others. Mostly it's served as the ongoing to-do list as well as notes for features in
progress.

==================================================================================================

Port to Android Wear
-- How to set up the emulator: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/49586/how-do-i-connect-an-android-wear-emulator-to-a-real-phone/
   adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601

-- How to connect to Bluetooth debugging for Moto 360: http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2014/07/16/common-android-wear-tasks-for-developers/
    adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub; adb connect 127.0.0.1:4444

-- How to get a dump from the watch into a file and see it while it's going
    adb -s localhost:4444 logcat -v time | & tee logdumps/whatever.txt


Daydream?
    http://www.hascode.com/2013/01/using-the-android-daydream-api/
    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/dreams/DreamService.html
    -- looks almost exactly the same as implementing an activity, or the watchface API

Miscellaneous updates
    TODO better no-calendar icon

    Other stuff, while we're overhauling things:
    TODO Change phone config panel to show three simultaneous watchfaces with picker rather than three text names

    TODO Adopt Wear Compatibility Library
    https://github.com/googlesamples/android-WearCompanionLibrary
    https://github.com/googlesamples/android-WclDemoSample
    - Unclear if there's any real benefit for CalWatch in these libraries

    TODO Validate that CrashReporter still works

Refactoring / reengineering
    TODO significant code overlap between mobile/MyViewAnim and wear/CalWatchFaceService
    - but differences are significant enough that it's not going to be very easy to move to /shared
    - factoring out the GoogleAPI stuff wasn't too bad, probably straightforward to refactor other stuff the same way

    TODO fix Gradle, presently requiring me to have the git version code in three places to work right
    (I tried putting it just in settings.gradle or the top-level build.gradle and this didn't work)

    TODO Rip out Observer/Listener logic (getting untenable) and redo with functional-reactive style
    - Changes would be localized to CalendarFetcher, which is now working in a vaguely functional style,
      in that the background task has no side-effects whatsoever, and the ultimate assignment that sticks
      around happens on the UI thread. Another big change with release4 was that the CalendarFetcher doesn't
      run at all when the watch is asleep. The background service is gone. This leads to the first-thing-
      in-the-morning behavior where you pull the watch off the charger, you briefly see a partial calendar,
      or none at all, but it's quickly replaced with your proper calendar.

    TODO too much .toFloat() and .toDouble() in ClockFace -- cleanup?!
    - We could try to standardize everything with Float, but many of the trig function in Math require Double
    - Twice I've tried standardizing on Float and things break: loss of the second-hand (!), and misalignment of the stipple pattern,
      so the thing to try next is standardizing on Double.
    - There's something really subtle and weird about how Kotlin does floating point that I'm clearly missing.

Right-to-left support
    TODO detect when we're in RTL mode
    TODO swap day/date block from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock or leave alone?

Add internationalization strings
    Currently have localized strings for Spanish, Dutch, Turkish, German; need more

Deal with multiday events that aren't "all day" events
    TODO idea: resurrect all-day events by rendering them (and long events) as thin rings, perhaps separate from the main time wedges

TODO update the slides
    Now a standard lecture in Comp215, so some updates in there already, but should it change
    from an "evolution of CalWatch" into a "how to code for Android" talk? Or not? Also, worth
    adding Kotlin material.


Overhaul preferences pane on mobile
    Broad goal: zero text, all icons, no more need for i18n

    TODO create vertical layout, not just horizontal
    TODO PhoneActivity: manage the new imageButtons. When buttons are clicked, flip the switches.
        TODO make sure this changes the state!
    TODO PhoneActivity: put localized day/date into the button
    TODO RPC: add transmission / reception of stepCounter
    TODO ClockState: storage of stepCounter state
    TODO ClockFace: read stepCounter state from ClockState
    TODO verify appearance on multiple phones / watches

TODO replace BIND_LISTENER with new alternative structure
    http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2016/04/deprecation-of-bindlistener.html
