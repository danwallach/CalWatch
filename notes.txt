If you look at the full Git history of this file, you'll see it grew quite large at some points and
shrank down at others. Mostly it's served as the ongoing to-do list as well as notes for features in
progress.

==================================================================================================

Port to Android Wear
-- How to set up the emulator: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/49586/how-do-i-connect-an-android-wear-emulator-to-a-real-phone/
   adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601

-- How to connect to Bluetooth debugging for Moto 360: http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2014/07/16/common-android-wear-tasks-for-developers/
    adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub; adb connect localhost:4444

-- How to get a dumb from the watch into a file and see it while it's going
    adb -s localhost:4444 logcat -v time | & tee logdumps/whatever.txt


TODO sort out how to compile protobufs automatically via Gradle
-- At least the Square protobuf runtime is automatically fetched and compiled

Verify all the weird connect/disconnect corner cases
    TODO fresh boot of phone, make sure service is up no matter what
    TODO disconnect / reconnect of phone from watch
    TODO fresh boot of watch / reconnect to old phone app
    TODO nothing running on phone / fresh watch wants data
    TODO are we recovering properly if the phone kills the service after a long hiatus?

Daydream?
    http://www.hascode.com/2013/01/using-the-android-daydream-api/
    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/dreams/DreamService.html
    -- looks almost exactly the same as implementing an activity, or the watchface API

Refactoring / reengineering
    TODO alarm code is repeated on phone and wear side: do it in /shared
    (this is waiting until we have a final idea of how we're supposed to implement a wear app)

Right-to-left support
    TODO detect when we're in RTL mode
    TODO swap day/date block from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock or leave alone?
