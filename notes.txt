Performance
   TODO do we have a performance problem? we're getting 30fps on LG watch, 55+ FPS on N5 with small face

DONE?! deal with recurring events
-- RecurrenceProcessor.expand() seems to do exactly what I want. Hypothetically, this is going to
   be a quick hack, if it work.

   maybe I need a better RFC 2245 (iCal) parser? Google has one:
   https://code.google.com/p/google-rfc-2445/

   Curiously, it's blowing up on the E2E VIV office hours, which has an exDate field of this:
   America/Los_Angeles;20140815T100000,20140822T100000,20140829T100000)

   The claim is that there's a "missing LHS" in the timezone part. Hrmm.

Port to Android Wear
-- Useful article including sample code: http://toastdroid.com/2014/07/18/developing-watchfaces-for-android-wear/
-- How to set up the damn emulator: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/49586/how-do-i-connect-an-android-wear-emulator-to-a-real-phone/
   adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601

    TODO verify on round face
    TODO support the "real" watchface API?

        https://github.com/kentarosu/androidwear-myfirstwatchface

        TODO "sample" face for selector
        TODO deal with dimming (kill second hand? lower frame rate? all white?) "Ambient mode"


TODO sort out how to compile protobufs automatically via Gradle (vs. known bugs lodged with Google)
-- At least the Square protobuf runtime is automatically fetched and compiled
-- Seems to be compiling correctly, might even work on the first try (ha!)

TODO fancier control panel: Material Layout cards

Verify all the weird connect/disconnect corner cases
    TODO fresh boot of phone, make sure service is up no matter what
    TODO disconnect / reconnect of phone from watch
    TODO fresh boot of watch / reconnect to old phone app
    TODO nothing running on phone / fresh watch wants data
    TODO are we recovering properly if the phone kills the service after a long hiatus?

TODO get a real app icon
DONE?! slower refresh rate when second hand not being displayed
TODO app signing
TODO smarter DrawArc

DONE! make battery gauge pretty
TODO if we're coming back from being asleep, make sure we invalidate the batteryPathCache

DONE! fix regression: we're not clipping the events to the visible 12 hour window
  Also, we now send 24 hours of events at once and do all the clipping in the watch, meaning
  that the watch will have something useful to show in the morning even if it's been disconnected
  from the phone all night (e.g., if charging in different parts of the house)



Notes on supporting a "real" watch face (via reading over:
https://github.com/twotoasters/watchface-template/tree/master/submodules

 Gears library:
    Activity.java: nothing interesting at all
    DeviceUtils.java: totally cheesy way of determining AMOLED: lookup
      table based on device type
    Watch.java:
      - an intent called KEEP_WATCHFACE_AWAKE
      - logic to deal with changing timezones
      - onTimeChanged() via alarm manager when seconds are turned off (do we care?)

  mobile/src/main/AndroidMainfest.xml:
    uses-permission for background
    preview.png

    (BOTH DONE! -- but need to redo the preview image once the face graphics settles down)

  wear/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:
    more permission usage
    some funkiness about how the activity is set up (providing background, etc.)

    (BOTH DONE!)

  Meanwhile, there's all this business about Square's various testing
  and code injection libraries. Probably not worth bothering
  now. Maybe later.
