If you look at the full Git history of this file, you'll see it grew quite large at some points and
shrank down at others. Mostly it's served as the ongoing to-do list as well as notes for features in
progress.

==================================================================================================

Port to Android Wear
-- How to set up the emulator: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/49586/how-do-i-connect-an-android-wear-emulator-to-a-real-phone/
   adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601

-- How to connect to Bluetooth debugging for Moto 360: http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2014/07/16/common-android-wear-tasks-for-developers/
    adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub; adb connect localhost:4444

-- How to get a dump from the watch into a file and see it while it's going
    adb -s localhost:4444 logcat -v time | & tee logdumps/whatever.txt


TODO sort out how to compile protobufs automatically via Gradle
-- At least the Square protobuf runtime is automatically fetched and compiled
-- this is going away, since all we now need to send are an int and two booleans

Verify all the weird connect/disconnect corner cases
    TODO fresh boot of phone, make sure service is up no matter what
    TODO disconnect / reconnect of phone from watch
    TODO fresh boot of watch / reconnect to old phone app
    TODO nothing running on phone / fresh watch wants data
    TODO are we recovering properly if the phone kills the service after a long hiatus?

Daydream?
    http://www.hascode.com/2013/01/using-the-android-daydream-api/
    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/dreams/DreamService.html
    -- looks almost exactly the same as implementing an activity, or the watchface API

Refactoring / reengineering
    TODO alarm code is repeated on phone and wear side: do it in /shared
    (this is waiting until we have a final idea of how we're supposed to implement a wear app)

    TODO fix Gradle, presently requiring me to have the git version code in three places to work right
    (I tried putting it just in settings.gradle or the top-level build.gradle and this didn't work)

Right-to-left support
    TODO detect when we're in RTL mode
    TODO swap day/date block from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock or leave alone?

Add internationalization strings
    Currently have localized strings for Spanish, Dutch, Turkish, German; need more

Deal with multiday events that aren't "all day" events
    TODO idea: resurrect all-day events by rendering them (and long events) as thin rings, perhaps separate from the main time wedges

FINAL ANDROID WATCHFACE API !!!
    TODO Does the existing APK break on Wear 5?
    TODO Migrate functionality from MyViewAnim and WearActivity into CalWatchFaceService
        TODO initially get 1Hz refresh rate, then sort out how to go faster
        TODO companion configuration activity
            TODO intents
            TODO XML manifest stuff
            - http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/configuration.html
        TODO redo ambient mode
            TODO hollow out the hands
            TODO hollow out the time wedges
            TODO disable anti-aliasing
                TODO quick-n-dirty just add new colors and make the rendering more complex
                TODO fancy: color getter/setters (simpler rendering, more complex color management)
            TODO don't render the power-remaining dot in ambient mode
    TODO Verify that enough of the calendar exists on watch side to avoid transmission from phone
    Secondary porting issues
        TODO Kill off Protobufs? All we've got is a couple small integers and booleans left
            - Low priority. We want to get the port up and running.
        TODO specify where the battery-charging indicator goes
            - http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/issues.html
        TODO extra screen squish when a peek card is visible?
        TODO update the slides
        UNTESTED/DONE port CalendarFetcher to run on phone *and* watch
        TODO reengineer CalendarFetcher so it doesn't run on a separate thread
