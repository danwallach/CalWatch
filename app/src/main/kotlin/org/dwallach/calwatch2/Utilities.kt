    // Rant: Notice how we're constraining the V type parameter to be Any rather than
    // the most unconstrained Any? type? The Kotlin stdlib really should do something
    // similar but doesn't. Go look at the code for getOrPut(), and you'll see that
    // its V type can be anything. This means that they cannot differentiate the case
    // when the underlying hashmap returns null on a get() -- and therefore you need to
    // compute and store a new value -- versus the case when your function returned
    // null, and now you'll be recomputing it every time.

    // The root issue here is that when you use the Kotlin type system to manage nullity,
    // using null like it's Option.None and non-null like Option.Some, then you need
    // to make sure you never try to have a hashmap or whatever where the value type
    // is itself nullable.

    // Also, there's a secondary rant to be had here. Java8 defines Map.computeIfAbsent()
    // which does roughly the same thing as Kotlin's MutableMap.getOrPut(), except it's
    // somewhat more efficient. Here you're creating a new closure to send to getOrPut()
    // every time where Java can reuse the same lambda every time. This is all irrelevant
    // for how we're actually using F.memoize(), but it's the sort of API design issue
    // that could creep up on you if you weren't being careful. But even if we preferred
    // the Java8 function, it's not available for SDK23 and we're preferring Kotlin stdlib
    // functions whenever available.
