What's where:

notes.txt -- ongoing work, notes, to-do items, etc.

/images -- screen dumps and assorted graphics
    (note: "resample.csh", at the top level, starts from a
     high-resolution screen dump and generates preview images at all
     the correct resolutions; these downstream dependencies are all
     checked in, so unless you're changing the the icon, you don't
     need to rerun this csh script. Also note that you'll need the
     Imagemagick package installed to run it.)

/logdumps -- logcat plus notes from the various times that CalWatch has blown up

/mobile -- code that runs only on the phone
    src/androidTest/java/ -- some old unit tests for event layout
    src/main/kotlin/ -- CalWatch source-code files

/shared -- code that runs on both the phone and on the watch
    src/main/java/
        EDU.Washington.grad.gjb.cassowary -- the Cassowary linear constraint solver

        - The code here is essentially unchanged from the original
          (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cassowary/), but with
          tweaks to compile under newer Java versions, including
          updates to use the newer parametric HashMap versus the
          older non-parametric Hashtable.

    src/main/kotlin/
        org.dwallach.calwatch/ -- CalWatch Kotlin files

/wear -- code that runs only on the watch

If you look at code prior to release4, you'll see that this project was written entirely in Java.
Starting with release4, I ported most everything to Kotlin and did a ton of code cleanup.
